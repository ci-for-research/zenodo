################################################################################
üë©‚ÄçüöÄ üì° üî¨ Continuous Integration for Scientific Applications
################################################################################
This repository contains a brief example of Continuous integration for scientific applications,
using miniconda_ and Python3.

Overview
********
`Continuous Integration <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ (**CI**) helps to automate the testing and delivery of scientific software tools. A **CI** is just a workflow that runs automatically ü§ñ as a result of a certain action
taken in the source code (e.g. a push, pull-request, etc.).

This repository contains 3 different configuration files for *Github Actions*, *Travis* and *Gitlab CI*. These configuration files encode the actions to perform with the code on a given architecture, like installing the library from scratch in a Ubuntu machine.

###########################
üõ†Ô∏è Setting up a CI workflow
###########################

|octocat| GitHub actions
************************
The *Github actions* configuration can be found at `Python actions file <.github/workflows/pythonapp.yml>`_. There is comprehensive documentation of what `Github actions`_ are and how to use them.

|Travis| Travis CI
******************
The `Travis configuration file <.travis.yml>`_ contains the configuration to call a **CI** workflow using *Travis*. See `Travis tutorial`_.

|gitlab| GitLab CI
*********
The `GitLabCI configuration file <.gitlab-ci.yml>`_ contains the configuration to call a **CI** workflow using the *Gitlab CI*. A comprehensive documentation is available for the `GitLab CI`_ tool.

Azure pipelines
***************
If you want to use `Azure pipelines, <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/>`_ have a look at `Tania Allard's great tutorial <https://github.com/trallard/ci-research>`_.

##################################
üöÄ Running on your own infrascture
##################################
Sometimes you want to have more control over the hardware infrascture, compilers, etc. when performing
continuous integration. *GitHub Actions* and *GitLab CI/CD* allow you to set up your infrascture.
The following links contains a guide to help you run a **CI** workflow on your own infrascture:

- `GitLab CI/CD self-hosted runner <https://github.com/NLESC-JCER/gitlab_runner>`_
- `GitHub Actions self-hosted runnner <https://github.com/NLESC-JCER/linux_actions_runner>`_


###############################
üéÆ Running the package examples
###############################
This package contains a toy example to estimate the value of œÄ using the `Monte Carlo method`_.
To run the Monte Carlo calculator, you will need to have python install. We recommend you
create a `conda virtual environment <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`_ by following the instructions below,

1. Get a copy of `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
2. Create a new environment by running the following command:
    ``conda create --name ci_for_science python=3.7 -y -q``
3. Activate the environment:
    ``conda activate ci_for_science``

Now to install this package,

4. `Fork and clone this repo <https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>`_
5. install cython:
    ``pip install cython``
6. install the library from the repo root folder:
    ``cd ci_for_science && pip install -e .``
7. run the command line interface like:
    ``compute_pi -n 1000``
The previous command will estimate œÄ using 1000 random points.
